We use MaNGA because they represent some of the most pristine data we have for recovering stellar populations in galaxies, with resolved IFU spectroscopy that allows us to get past traditional concerns like outshining (by being able to resolve the young and old light coming from different parts of the galaxy) and parameter degeneracies (by having extremely high-resolution and high-SNR spectra). </p> <p>The fact that this works at all means that the morphologies of galaxies contain equivalent information about stellar assembly to what we can get from galaxy spectra. And while this is scientifically interesting, it is also very encouraging for future telescopes like Rubin and Euclid that will have a really wide footprint (i.e. will see many many galaxies) in a small number of filters, since it will enable us to do science with star formation histories using the data from these telescopes.</p> <p>But the point of Katachi was not to just predict the SFHs, but to understand what the morphological imprints are that allowed the network to make this prediction in the first place. This motivation comes from a place of not wanting methods like Katachi to be pure predictive black boxes, but instead ML-enabled tools to perform model building utilizing all the information available from current and upcoming surveys (as opposed to throwing away information using summary statistics). </p> <p>To build in the explainable (XAI) aspect into Katachi, we experimented with a whole bunch of gradient based and other saliency methods to map the dependence of the final output back to its input images, and is perhaps the step that took the longest amount of time in the project. Ultimately, we settled on Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP, see an excellent explanation in Christoph Molnar's book), which essentially produces a map for each galaxy that shows which parts of the input image drive the prediction higher or lower. As an example, it will correctly identify clumps as contributing to higher SFR and younger ages in galaxies, and bulges as contributing to lower SFR / older ages. </p>"},{"location":"pages/links/","title":"Useful links","text":"<ul> <li>My PhD thesis</li> <li>My publications on ADS</li> <li>Pan-survey SED forum</li> <li>UniverseTBD</li> <li>Useful places to keep track of astronomy conferences<ul> <li>CADC </li> <li>Lorentz center </li> <li>KITP </li> <li>Aspen </li> </ul> </li> <li>Starting points for literature surveys:<ul> <li>ADS - note that ADS has a bunch of features that folks don't use regularly, such as the <code>similar()</code>, <code>reviews()</code> and <code>trending()</code> secondary operators</li> <li>Pathfinder - semantic search for astonomy papers</li> <li>benty-fields - a replacement for voxcharta, vote and discuss papers during journal clubs</li> <li>google scholar - still my go-to for papers beyond astronomy</li> <li>astrobites - blog-style summaries of papers</li> <li>arXivsorter , semanticscholar, connectedpapers </li> <li>Papers With Code, Astrophysics Source Code Library, Journal of Open Source Software </li> </ul> </li> <li>Astronomy starter pack (from .Astronomy 11 in 2019)</li> <li>Generative tools:<ul> <li>Generative text models: Claude / Gemini / ChatGPT / perplexity etc. </li> <li>Quick RAG for working with documents: NotebookLM (though most public LLM services provide some version of this these days)</li> <li>Text-to-image models: Stable diffusion / Flux / midjourney / imagen / dall-e</li> </ul> </li> <li>Visualization stuff: Coolors, markdown , openseadragon, openspace, bokeh , streamlit </li> <li>Code stuff<ul> <li>Github tutorials here, here and here, more stuff for students</li> <li>OpenAstronomy Python Packaging Guide </li> <li>Packages I find useful: emcee (MCMC), dynesty (nested sampling), george, ltu-ili (SBI), python-fsps (stellar population modeling), pySR (symbolic regression)</li> <li>easy readme and badges for github projects: readme.so </li> </ul> </li> <li>Time management / collaboration:<ul> <li>mattermost - local alternative to slack/discord</li> <li>read.ai - summary/meeting notes for zoom</li> </ul> </li> <li>NSF funding opportunities </li> <li>AAS job register </li> <li>This or this or this </li> </ul> <p>Less broadly useful but still rather fun:</p> <ul> <li>JWST HLSPs (high level science products) on MAST </li> <li>Requesting an allocation on NASA computational facilities</li> <li>A comparison of different samplers by mattpitkin </li> <li>the best introduction to Gaussian processes on distill.pub (apart from the standard reference textbook by Rasmussen and Williams: GPML )</li> <li>explore the relation between distributions</li> <li>amazing collection of astrophotography: https://welcome.astrobin.com/ </li> <li>Labocine - movies from phd theses?</li> <li>Hearing the shape of a drum </li> <li>NYC Coronavirus wastewater surveillance </li> <li></li> </ul> <p>Writing: </p> <ul> <li>J.

A lot of my work focuses on decoding the life stories of galaxies - how they form stars, interact with their environments, and change over billions of years. In this, studying galaxies is similar to studying the rise and fall of other complex systems like cities or forests - there are processes acting on many different scales in space and time that affect them, and understanding their interplay gives us insights into why they are so diverse when observed as a population. For a city, this could mean its location (is it near a river or trade route), the demographics of its population (what is the median age of the workforce? are people settling there or leaving?), and its self-regulatory processes (how do prices/taxes go up/down in response to various factors?). You can find my talks about galaxy evolution at a public level here or at a conference/colloquium-like level here or here (more talks in the travel &amp; outreach pages). </p> <p>When it comes to galaxy evolution, my research interests broadly span the following areas:</p> <ul> <li>What are the physical processes that regulate star formation in galaxies? What scales do they act on and what physical imprints do they leave in their stellar populations?</li> <li>How can we robustly infer the physical properties of galaxies from their multiwavelength observations?</li> <li>What can cosmological simulations tell us about how feedback and baryon cycling are imprinted on present-day galaxy populations? </li> <li>How can theoretical models of star formation as a stochastic process help bridge theory / simulations and observations? </li> <li>How do galaxies form at the earliest epochs of the universe? How is star formation different at these epochs under more extreme conditions, how do the first supermassive black holes form? </li> <li>What is the relation between galaxies and their globular cluster populations today? What clues can looking at star clusters in the distant past provide?</li> <li>What factors explain the observed diversity of galaxies today, and how is that tied to their past?</li> </ul> <p>More generally, I like to find interesting use-cases for astrostatistics and machine learning in noisy, heterogeneous datasets, and am a big fan of developing interpretable or physically-motivated ML methods, or using AI for model building. This ranges from studies like Katachi (which shows which parts of an input galaxy image drive a networks prediction about its past star formation activity) to GP-SFH (which uses physical prescriptions in a Gaussian process kernel to infer star formation variability in a population of galaxies). </p> <p>Over the last five-ish years, I have also been interested in the problem of keeping up with the rapidly increasing astronomy literature, and have been looking for better methods to keep up with it, ranging from literature survey and knowledge discovery to hypothesis generation. The recent introduction of large language models in this area has revolutionized what we can do, and I am excited to see where we will go from here!</p>"},{"location":"pages/sf_feedback/","title":"SFHs and feedback","text":"<p>A range of physical processes regulate how galaxies from stars, and are thought to act over different characteristic spatial and temporal scales (see figure below from Iyer et al. 2020<sup>1</sup>).

However, all that information is summed up in the spectrum of a galaxy (with recent populations much more heavily featured than older ones), so it is a difficult problem to disentangle them. Traditionally, SFHs were dealt with as a nuisance parameter, something for people estimating stellar masses and star formation rates from galaxy spectra to marginalize over, but in recent times there has been a renewed focus on actually getting information about the SFH - partly because of better techniques and partly due to better data. In particular, a class of non-parametric approaches has been used to describe the shape of the SFHs that we are estimating from the data - non-parametric because it doesn't require a specific functional form, and is largely data-driven. The nice thing about this is that if your data is informative, you can get a lot of information about a galaxy's SFH without imposing prior beliefs on its shape, but if your data is poor you end up with larger uncertainties on all SFH-related parameters (like mass and SFR) due to the more unconstrained parameter space. </p> <p>I've developed the Dense Basis method for non-parametric SFH reconstruction<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>, which works on the premise that one of the most efficient ways of describing the shape of a general function is through its percentiles/quantiles.  In practice, this is implemented as a set of lookback times when a galaxy formed certain quantiles of its total stars. It can either be linearly spaced (the default option), or logarithmic (for slightly better reconstruction of the recent SFR, especially at high-z), or a set of custom quantiles. Now these quantiles by themselves do not uniquely describe an SFH, since they are just individual points (X% mass formed, t\\(_X\\)) between when the galaxy started forming stars (0% mass formed, t\\(_{form}\\)) and the time of observation (100% mass formed, t\\(_{lookback}\\)=0), and any interpolation function can be used to create a curve of (mass formed vs time), and taking its derivative gives us the SFH. With a linear interpolation, it is equivalent to SFR in bins that's used in methods like VESPA<sup>3</sup>. But we can do better! </p> <p>By modeling the SFHs as a stochastic process (specifically a Gaussian process), we can incorporate physical information about how the SFH varies between two constraining times (tX). We do this using something called a kernel (or autocovariance function, or 2-point function, depending on what space you work in) that encodes the correlation between stat formation rates at two times \\(K(t,t')\\). Physically, this is interesting because it explicitly allows you to specify (and thus constrain) the extent to which galaxy star formation rates are correlated across time (by a common physical process acting to regulate the SFR, whether that's angular momentum support from the disk, elevated SFRs due to a gas-rich merger, or quenching due to AGN activity). While the default Dense Basis implementation corresponds to a scenario with a single correlation timescale, the GP-SFH project extended this using an extended regulator model<sup>4</sup> which has a kernel with effective timescales corresponding to gas inflows, baryon cycling, and dynamical effects. Modeling SFHs as stochastic processes is well motivated by observations and theory (e.g.<sup>5</sup>), and has subsequently been used in a range of studies<sup>6</sup><sup>7</sup>. </p> <p>In addition to the wealth of historical star formation activity unlocked by these methods, they also provide more robust estimates of galaxy properties including stellar masses and star formation rates by avoiding the biases of fixed functional forms<sup>1</sup>. These tools have been instrumental in analyzing data from large Hubble surveys like CANDELS and JWST surveys including CEERS &amp; CANUCS, enabling systematic studies of galaxy evolution across cosmic time. These studies have revealed several interesting phenomena, including the prevalence of rejuvenated galaxies<sup>2</sup>, the increased burstiness in interacting galaxies at high-z<sup>8</sup>, or the earlier quenching in galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN) at low-z<sup>9</sup>. Dense Basis has also been incorporated into other modern SED fitting tools like Bagpipes, piXedfit and sleuth to further enhance its applications to analyzing spectrophotometry or spatially-resolved observations.</p> <p>References:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Kartheik Iyer and Eric Gawiser.

By using the multiwavelength light from the sparkles, we showed these objects were likely globular clusters - the same type of ancient star clusters we see orbiting our Milky Way today, but seen at a time shortly after they had just formed, over 9 billion years ago. Thanks to JWST\u2019s incredible angular resolution and magnification of the galaxy by gravitational lensing, this was the first time we'd been able to resolve and study such distant globular clusters, opening a new window into understanding how these ancient stellar systems formed. You can read more about the Sparkler galaxy and explore the data on the CANUCS website or read the paper led by Lamiya Mowla &amp; me<sup>1</sup> below.</p> <p>More recently, the CANUCS team discovered the Firefly Sparkle galaxy<sup>2</sup> in JWST observations of the MACS 1423 cluster. This galaxy exists even further back in time, when the universe was only 600 million years old. What makes it particularly interesting is that it has about the same mass we think the Milky Way had at that age. Most galaxies we find from this early epoch tend to be much more massive, so the Firefly Sparkle gives us a rare opportunity to study how more typical galaxies like our own first assembled. You can read more about the galaxy in this NASA press release.</p> <p>These discoveries are part of my broader research using JWST to understand the formation of globular clusters and their ties to galaxy assembly, but also trying to understand star formation in extreme environments at high redshifts. By studying these ancient systems, we're piecing together how galaxies like our Milky Way built up their stars and structure over cosmic time.
