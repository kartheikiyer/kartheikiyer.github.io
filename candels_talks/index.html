								<h3>Constraining the Major Merger Rate History of the Universe since z~3: Comprehensive Analysis of Close Pairs and Tidal Features using Observations and Simulations</h3>
								<h2>Kameswara Bharadwaj Mantha </h2>
								<p>University of Missouri, Kansas City | 13<sup>th</sup> July, 2020</p>
						  </header>
							<p>The role of major mergers in galaxy evolution remains a key open question. Major merger rate estimates based on galaxy-galaxy pairs, non-parametric morphological metrics, and subjective visual classifications often are in tension with each other and with theoretical expectations, especially at redshifts 1&lt;z&lt;3. The lack of rigorous calibrations for observational systematics and observability timescales of galaxy close pairs and hallmark tidal interaction signatures are some of the reasons behind this tension. To help resolve this, we analyze the redshift evolution of the major close-pair fraction (stellar mass ratio&lt;4) among massive (log M<sub>*</sub>/M<sub>sun</sub> &gt;10) galaxies between 0.5&lt;z&lt;3.0 in the SantaCruz Semi-Analytical Model based mock lightcones. By systematically including CANDELS-like observational effects (photometric redshift and stellar mass uncertainties, detection incompleteness), we derive statistical pair fraction calibration corrections for common pair selection functions used in the literature. We find that i) ~35% of the pairs selected by photometric redshift selection have small velocities (&lt;500 km/s), ii) including stellar-mass errors impacts major pair selection with only ~85% (65%) of the true major pairs being selected at z~1 (z~3), iii) the incompleteness correction is ~10% (~20%) at z~2 (z~3) for the CANDELS-Wide depth. We also quantify the pair fraction variation among different CANDELS-sized fields and find that it increases from 1% to 1.5% between 0.5&lt;z&lt;3. We apply these corrections to the empirical CANDELS pair fractions and our preliminary results suggest that the calibrated pair fraction evolution remains flat (at ~10%) during 2&lt;z&lt;3. For tidal indicators, we are analyzing the high time resolution synthetic CANDELS H-band images of galaxy mergers from the Horizon-AGN simulation. Using our newly-developed morphological substructure extraction software, we hope to calibrate quantitative metrics associated with tidal features (e.g., surface brightness, size, curvature) to the physical properties of merging progenitors (mass ratio, orbital parameters), and their observability timescales. These calibrations will enable us to robustly constrain the major merger history of massive galaxies since z~3.</p>

								<h3>Probing the Nature of Dark Matter through Measurements of Galaxy Shapes and Redshifts: Sciences with HST/CANDELS for Future Wide-Area Surveys</h3>
								<h2>BoMee Lee </h2>
								<p>Caltech/IPAC | 10<sup>th</sup> August, 2020</p>
						  </header>
							<p>Measuring weak gravitational lensing (WL), a powerful probe of the distribution of large scale structure, is one of the primary science goals of future large extragalactic surveys with Euclid, Rubin and Roman. In order to reconstruct a three dimensional weak lensing map of dark matter in different redshift bins, it is crucial to constrain both galaxy shapes and photometric redshifts very well. Currently, the WL analysis has primarily been based on optical band imaging, limiting results to z &lt; 1; Euclid and Rubin will detect cosmic shear with optical imaging over many thousands of square degrees. In this talk, I will first introduce a template library that populates three-color space and is constrained by HST/CANDELS photometry. This improves the photometric redshift estimates for future surveys, which will only have a limited number of bands at the relevant sensitivities. Second, I will introduce our HST Legacy archive project constraining the masses of galaxy over-densities at z &gt; 1 in the CANDELS and COSMOS through weak gravitational lensing in the near-IR. This study will serve as a critical stepping stone for near-IR shear measurements with upcoming space-based WL surveys with Euclid and Roman.</p>

								<h3>The MOSDEF Survey: The environmental imprint on the gas-phase metallicity of galaxies at 1.37 &lt; z &lt; 2.61 </h3>
								<h2>Nima Chartab Soltani </h2>
								<p>UC Riverside | 24<sup>th</sup> August, 2020</p>
						  </header>
							<p>With a wealth of near-IR spectroscopy for the star-forming galaxies in the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey, combined with the local environment measurements derived from accurate and uniformly calculated photometric redshifts with well-calibrated probability distributions, we investigate the role of the local environment in mass-metallicity relation (MZR) of the MOSDEF galaxies at 1.37 &lt; z &lt; 2.61. Based on the N2=[NII]6584/Ha indicator, we measure gas-phase oxygen abundance of 167 galaxies at 1.37 &lt; z &lt; 1.7 and 303 galaxies at 2.09 &lt; z &lt; 2.61, which are located in diverse environments. We find that at z &sim;1.5, the average galaxies with 10^{9.5} Msun &lt; M&lt; 10^{11} Msun which reside in overdensities have  &sim;0.084 &plusmn; 0.024 (3.5sigma) dex higher metallicity compared to their field counterparts. However, this metallicity enhancement does not exist at higher redshift, z &sim; 2.3, where we find   &sim;0.096 &plusmn; 0.027 (3.7sigma) lower metallicity for galaxies in an overdense environment than that of field galaxies. Our results suggest that at the early stage of cluster formation (z &gt; 3), overdensities host a higher fraction of pristine gas with prominent cold mode accretion rate, which lowers their gas-phase metallicity compared to their coeval field galaxies. However, as galaxies in overdensities evolve to lower redshifts, they become metal-rich rapidly due to the suppression of pristine gas inflow and metal-enriched infall gas in overdensities.</p>

								<h3>The nature of giant clumps in CANDELS galaxies with deep learning: from simulations to observations </h3>
								<h2>Marc Huertas-Company </h2>
								<p>Observatoire de Paris | 21<sup>st</sup> September, 2020</p>
						  </header>
							<p>I will review the results of two recent papers in which we study the nature of giant clumps in CANDELS galaxies using deep learning. I will first describe a new CNN based method to detect clumps in galaxy images. I will then show new constraints on the stellar mass function of clumps which suggest an in-situ origin for the majority of the observed clumps. I will finally discuss recent attempts to determine the lifetimes of the clumps using neural networks trained on numerical simulations.</p>
