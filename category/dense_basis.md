Code development has started, and a github repo is now live! See it here:

<div class="github-card" data-github="kartheikiyer/dense_basis" data-width="400" data-height="150" data-theme="default"></div>
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/github-cards/latest/widget.js"></script>

Dec 31, 2019: The code is now beta, with tutorials and documentation live at [dense-basis.readthedocs.io](https://dense-basis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The package is also released on pypi, and can be installed using `pip install dense-basis`.

Dec 24, 2019: The code is still very much in alpha-testing phase. Please open issues if you see anything acting odd or have a feature that you'd like to see.
