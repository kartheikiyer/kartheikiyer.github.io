<p class="message">
  Hallo. I'm a Dunlap Postdoctoral Fellow at the Dunlap Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics within the University of Toronto. I infer the star formation histories of galaxies from observations, and study them in conjunction with simulations to better understand how galaxies evolve. I'm also interested in applying statistics and Machine Learning methods
to low S/N problems in astrophysics.

My publications can be found on [ADS](https://bit.ly/30rpGdJ). 

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions regarding my research, or are interested in using the Dense Basis code for fitting your sample of Spectral Energy Distributions to reconstruct the star formation histories of galaxies. I am currently located at

AB 205, Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, \\
50 St. George Street,
Toronto, Ontario,
CA - M5S 3H4.
