<p class="message">
  Hallo. I'm a Dunlap Postdoctoral Fellow at the Dunlap Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics within the University of Toronto. I infer the star formation histories of galaxies from observations, and study them in conjunction with simulations to better understand how galaxies evolve. I'm also interested in applying statistics and Machine Learning methods
to low S/N problems in astrophysics.
